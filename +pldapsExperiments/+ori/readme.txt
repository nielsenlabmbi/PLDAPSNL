Headfixed ferret training protocol, paradigms: 
 
1. Port acclimation, found in the test folder. Moves the ports periodically, independent of input. 

2. Free center lick - this dispenses reward from the center spout whenever it is licked. 

3. Phase0 - runs trials consisting of initiation stimulus > center spout presented > lick and receive reward.
3a. Phase01 - runs trials where each spout is presented on its own.  

4. Phase1 - runs trials where after presenting the middle spout, both side spouts are presented.
Whichever side spout is licked is rewarded, and the opposite spout is withdrawn. 
Allows the user to dynamically adjust the wait time between the removal of the center spout and
presentation of the side spouts. Previously used to test for coincident licking. 

5. Phase2 - the same as phase1, but reward is presented differently (continuous rather than pulse) 

6. Phase3 - not yet created, could test that when one spout is not rewarded, the ferret licks the other spout 
In other words, force-correct trial testing. But I think I opted to wait to do this with an easy stimulus, 
such as dots. 


After a sequence of the paradigms described above, move onto dots at 100% coherence
Then, ori with bar start cue and large orientation difference
